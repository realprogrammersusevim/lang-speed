# Language Speedtest

Micro-benchmarks for scripting language implementations comparing their speeds.
These aren't long or useful programs so don't choose a language or make any
decisions or assumptions based on the results.

## Languages

- Common Lisp
- Lua
- Python
- Ruby
- JavaScript
- Swift
- Perl
- Rust
- Julia
- Basic
- PHP

## Requirements

- Steel Bank Common Lisp
- CLisp
- Lua
- LuaJit
- Python 3.11
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.9
- PyPy 3
- Ruby
- Node
- Deno
- Swift
- Perl
- cargo-script
- Julia
- Basic 64k
- PHP
- Hyperfine

## But Rust and Swift aren't interpreted!

There's no such thing as an interpreted or compiled language only
implementations. If I can pass a single file with code to a program and get an
output that good enough for me.
